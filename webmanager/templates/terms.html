    <p>You and Dared My Best Friend waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any other dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services, including claims related to privacy and data security, (collectively, “Disputes”) resolved in court. Any dispute arising hereunder shall be resolved solely through binding arbitration conducted in Los Angeles, California under and pursuant to the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules available at www.adr.org. It is agreed that the arbitration shall be before a single arbitrator familiar with entertainment and intellectual property law and that proceedings will be held in San Francisco, California. Any award shall be final, binding, and non-appealable. No matter relating to the arbitration (including but not limited to, the testimony, evidence or result) may be (a) made public in any manner or form, (b) reported to any news agency or publisher and/or (c) disclosed to any third party not involved in the arbitration.</p>

    <p>You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this section by sending an email of your request to legal@definitelyreal.com. In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Disputes in accordance with the next section regarding “Governing Law and Venue.”</p>
    <p>If any portion of this section is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (b) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this section or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this section; and (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this section is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this section will be enforceable.</p>

    <p>These Terms and any dispute that arises between you and Dared My Best Friend will be governed by California without giving effect to any conflict of law principles.

    <p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></p>
    <p>Dared My Best Friend’s failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.
