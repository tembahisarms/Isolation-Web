    <p><strong>SHARING OF INFORMATION</strong></p>

    <p>We share personal information in the following circumstances or as otherwise described in this policy:
    
    <ul>
        <li>We share personal information with other users of the Services. For example, if you use our Services to publish content, post comments or send private notes, certain information about you will be visible to others, such as your name, user name, photo, or other account information you may provide.

If we are going to disclose your personal information in response to legal process, we will give you notice so you can challenge it (for example by seeking court intervention), unless we are prohibited by law or believe doing so may endanger others or cause illegal conduct. We will object to legal requests for information about users of our Services that we believe are improper.
        <li>We may share personal information if we believe that your actions are inconsistent with our user agreements or policies, if we believe that you have violated the law, or if we believe it is necessary to protect the rights, property, and safety of Dared My Best Friend, our users, the public, or others.

    </ul>


    <p><strong>THIRD-PARTY EMBEDS</strong></p>

    <p>Dared My Best Friend does not host some of the content displayed on our Services. Some of our content is actually hosted by a third party, but is embedded in our pages (an “Embed”). When you interact with an Embed, it can send information about your interaction to the hosting third party just as if you were visiting the third party’s site directly. For example, when you watch a YouTube video Embed, YouTube receives information about your activity, such as your IP address and how much of the video you watch. Dared My Best Friend does not control what information third parties collect through Embeds or what they do with the information. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected through Embeds. The privacy policy belonging to the third party hosting the Embed applies to any information the Embed collects, and we recommend you review that policy before interacting with the Embed.</p>


    <p><strong>TRANSFER OF INFORMATION TO THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES</strong></p>

    <p>Dared My Best Friend is headquartered in the United States, and we have operations and service providers in the United States and other countries. Therefore, we and our service providers may transfer your personal information to, or store or access it in, jurisdictions that may not provide levels of data protection that are equivalent to those of your home jurisdiction. For example, we transfer personal data to Amazon Web Services, one of our service providers that processes personal information for us in various data center locations across the globe. We will take steps to ensure that your personal information receives an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which we process it.</p>
